			<p align="justify">Domain.com (2021) says that tracert helps one to trouble shooting network connection. It gives a list of 'hops' that data packets while on route destination IP address or domain.  My scan yielded a maximum of 30 hops with the biggest delay being at step 14. The average delay was 222ms. Norton life lock & Steve (2021) indicates that such a long delay shows heavy traffic on the website hence making it unavailable. According to Elsevier (2021) Pathping just like tracert provides statistics on network latency and loss between two nodes by ascertaining the number of hops between them. The scan produced a maximum of 30 hops and a Round Trip Time (RTT) of 10ms.</p>
			<p align="justify">A2 Hosting (2021) says that Microsoft Windows uses nslookup software instead of dig software. During my scan, Nslookup revealed a number of Domain Name System (DNS) that support the website. According to Security Trails (2021) such information might be maliciously used for DNS hijacking or redirection where hackers redirect your traffic to a malicious website. Hackers may also conduct DNS poisoning/spoofing by maliciously redirecting traffic to the web server. The scan produced, the registered contact and the host of the website to be Amazon.com, Inc however the MX record was found to be empty. Such information might make the website susceptible to Phishing attacks and ransomware attacks. </p>

									<p align="justify">Lack of MX record could mean that the site is susceptible to phishing attacks. MX record ensure that only approved emails are sent from the domain. Cyber criminals set up fake domains that mimic genuine companies’ domains in an attempt to attack individuals with phishing emails. A genuine MX record ameliorates the reputation of a domain and ensure that emails are filtered and sent to the right parties as intended (Fraud Watch, 2016). </p>

									<p align="justify">Tracert uses ICMP packages that lesser precedence in transmission than TCP packages. Having heavy traffic on AWS websites is rather unlikely, since they have a lot of bandwidth. A more likely explanation for delay could be that the terminal is busy and is only slowly forwarding ICMP packages. Additionally there might be a lot of distance between the two terminals. Most probably they are a continent apart. Geolocation of two terminals could provide more insight (Parziale et al 2006).  </p>

						<p> An additional valuable post made by Jan Küfner indicates that Blank results consisting of asterisks followed by further hops does not mean that a firewall is blocking your computer totally. It only means that rules are in place at that node, that will not deliver an ICMP response to you, stating that time to live (TTL) has expired. Traffic with a TTL > 1 will be forwarded without any blocking. (Parziale et al 2006) </p>

						<p> Shiraj Ali make another very important post indicating that We want to extend on hop count difference between the members. (Fei et al., 1988)</p> <p>Measured Hop-Count and Round Trip Time (RTT) distribution from one host in the USA to about 3000 hosts scattered in four continents. They found out that RTT and HC to international hosts depend on the hosts' countries. The Hop-Count distribution seen from the six sources to all the destinations is calculated. Although the Hop-Count values vary between 6 and 30, more than 83% of the Hop-Count values are located between 11 and 21 hops only (Mukaddam and Elhajj, 2011).</p>
