			 	<font size="3" face="Arial"
				<h2>Domain</h2>
				<p align="justify"><small> The Dutch Police Internet Forensics (Government of the Netherlands, n.d.)
				</small></p> 
				<h4>System Design </h4>
				<p align="justify"><small> The proposed solution will use symmetric-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt short confidential messages using the same key. The messages form part of the evidence collected while conducting sensitive internet forensic investigation. According to Winderickx et al (2021) symmetric-key cryptography (Figure 1 in Appendix) solves the problem of privacy, unlinkability, shared validation, seamless secret transmission and distributed validation preventing the authentication server from being a single point of attack. </small></p>
				<h4>Overview of the Proposed Solution </h4>
				<p align="justify"><small> Figure 2 in the Appendix, shows the UML diagram of the proposed system. The users will be able to encrypt a short message using a key then send the same to the recipient who will decrypt the same using the same key sent to them. The encrypted message will be able to be stored in MySQL database as well as on their desktop as a binary file where the users can be able to retrieve them. </small></p>  
				<h4>Business and Technical Challenges</h4>
				<ol>
				<li> The organization is having a challenge of managing and storing important short messages that form part of evidence collected online.</li>
				<li> The organisation needs to ensure that they are adhering to privacy and security regulation when dealing with confidential data.</li>
				<li> The organisation should ensure that the system is protected against unauthorised access or hacking, malware, and denial of service attacks (Digitpol, 2021).  </li>
				</ol>

				<h4>Approach</h4>
				<p align="justify"><small> The design will be implemented using the Client-Server Architecture as shown in Figure 3 in the Appendix, the client could be a desktop computer, a laptop or Ipad used by users in the organization while the server will be MySQL database that will manage users and store the encrypted data. The cryptography software will also reside of the server. </small></p>
				<h4>Theories and Practices used on the Project</h4>
				<p align="justify"><small> According to Ayash (2010) the word "Cryptography” comes from Greek term kruptos, denoting "hidden". The secret of hiding data is to develop a hiding (encryption) system that is very challenging to locate the original data without using the decryption key. Cryptography is the science that utilizes arithmetic to encode and decode data. Sensitive data is encoded and sent over insecure networks to prevent unintended recipient form reading it. </small></p> 
				<h4>System Requirements </h4>
				<ol>
				<li>The anonymity and unlinkability of the users of the system must be guaranteed through symmetric-key cryptography (Winderickx et al, 2021).</li>
				<li> Perfect forward secrecy should be maintained to prevent adversaries from obtaining encrypted information (Winderickx et al, 2021) . </li>
				<li> The system should protect the data from potential attacks and vulnerabilities.</li>
				<li> The system must store encrypted information in a database and store a copy of the same in c drive in binary files.</li>
				<li> User training must be conducted to ensure that users understand the system and work with it us intended. </li>
				</ol>


				<h4>Assumptions </h4>
				<ol>
				<li> The system is assumed to be monitored by the information technology department of the Dutch Police Internet Forensics hence hackers should not be able to penetrate the database system. </li>
				<li> End users will communicate securely using the new system and abandon legacy systems of communication. </li>
				<li> End users will accept the new system. </li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Tools</h4>
				<ol>
				<li> MySQL Community Server 8.0 or higher for storing encrypted files, MySQL WorkBench CE for database design & MySQL Tutorial (Oracle Corporation, 2021).</li>
				<li> Python 3.9.6 for windows for compiling the python source codes (Python Software Foundation, 2021). </li>
				<li> Codio for compiling python source codes and MySQLdatabase online (Codio, 2021).</li>
				<li> pip install cryptography to Install cryptography library and create key on the codio terminal command line or Windows command line (King,2018). </li>
				</ol>

				<h2>B. Deliverable: Prototype based on Monolithic Paradigm</h2>  
                <h2> Symmetric Cryptography and Password Hashing</h2> 				
			</header>
					
				

			<h4> Installation of tools  </h4>

			<p align="justify"><small>Python provides a number of symmetric cryptography and password hashing choices within it’s hashlib library which encodes data and makes it visible to intended recipients only. symmetric cryptography utilizes a single key to encode and decode plain text. The key must be secured or else the capability to encode and decode is lost (King, 2018). Prior to executing cryptography source codes created by Group Two, Installation of the following software is paramount: </small></p>
			<ol>
			<li> MySQL Community Server 8.0, MySQL WorkBench CE & MySQL Tutorial.  You can download MySQL installer which contain these packages from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=506568 and install the above named software. Configure the root password as SSD123456p </li>
			<li> Python 3.9.6 for Windows. You can download Python 3.9.6 installer from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.6/python-3.9.6-amd64.exe. After the download is complete, proceed with the installation of the software mentioned above.  </li>
			</ol>
			<p align="justify"><small>After installing Python 3.9.6 it is important for you to install all the necessary libraries that support Flask, cryptography and MySQL Database. To install the library, go to the command line and type the following commands then press enter key: </small></p>
			<ol>
			<li> pip install mysql-connector-python</li>
			<li> pip install cryptography</li>
			<li> pip install Flask </li>
			<li> pip install hashlib</li>
			</ol>
			 
			<h4> Securing Passwords Using Hashlib Library</h4>  
			<p align="justify"><small>Hashing is so widely used in systems to conceal passwords. It has been used in this system to hide passwords in the database. The system can be used by multiple users with different ranks within the Dutch Police Internet Forensics for example, when a user registers, the password will be hashed using sha256 as shown in line 76 of the source codes in Figure 1.  The data is then validated and inserted in MySQL database. </small></p>

			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/register.jpg" alt="" />
			<h4> Figure 1: Password hashing with SHA 256 adopted and modified from David (2020) </h4>
			</span>
			</center>
             
			<p align="justify"><small>Figure 2: shows the registered users and their hashed password in MySQL database</small></p>

			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/hash.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			<p align="justify"><small>When the user attempts to login, the password that they type into the system is hashed and compared with that stored in MySQL database during the registration process. If they are equal, the user is allowed to login. Figure 3 shows the source codes. </small></p>
			
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/login.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>	
			<p align="justify"><small>Line 36 of the source codes in Figure 4 shows the password being hashed. </small></p>
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/loginru.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			<p align="justify"><small>For example, Figure 5: shows the home page once Jean logs in the system. When Jean clicks on profile, Figure 6 shows that her password is hashed. </small></p>
			
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/home.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>

			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/hashp.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			<h2> Symmetric Encryption</h2>
			<p align="justify"><small>The symmetric cryptography prototype has been inspired from King (2018) and modified to be able to encrypt and decrypt data while the output is stored in MySQL database. Every time a user creates a new message, a key is auto generated and used to encrypt the message. The encoded message and the key are then stored in the database. The key is then used on a later date and time to decrypt the message by the intended recipient. Figure 7 shows symmetric encryption source codes used to encrypt the messages. To encrypt a message, On the menu click on Encrypt to encrypt the message and the form shown in Figure 8 will open. Enter the message and the recipient’s name then click save. </small></p>  
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/cryptoru.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/logincry.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
            
			<p align="justify"><small>Figure 9 shows how the records look like in MySQL WorkBench. The keys and messages are seen as blobs.  This helps to secure the data from unauthorized users. A point to mention is that in a real life application, it would be a better option for the encryption keys to be stored in a separate server. The datatypes can also be renamed to conceal what they store. </small></p>

			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/enmessage.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			<p align="justify"><small>We can now register a new user who will now send a message to Jean. On the menu click on logout. On the login form click on register. Enter the Username as Woods, password as Dunlop#88!  and email address as redwoods@gmail.com as shown in Figure 10 . Click on register and login as Woods. </small></p>
				
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/newlogin.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>	
			<p align="justify"><small>On the menu click on Encrypt, enter a message that you intend to send to Jean as shown in Figure 11 and click on save. </small></p>
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/encry.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			<p align="justify"><small>From MySQL workbench, the output now looks as follows: </small></p>
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/save.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			<h4> Symmetric Decryption </h4>
			<p align="justify"><small>When decrypting documents, the same key that was used for encryption is used to decrypt the same message. The system retrieves both the message and the key then decrypts the message and finally displays the same. Figure 12 show the message that was sent to Jean by Woods </small></p> 
            <center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/endisplay.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			
			<p align="justify"><small>Figure 13 shows symmetric decryption source codes used in the system</small></p>
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/decryptocode.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			<h4> Testing</h4>
			<center>
			<span class="image">
			<img src="images/testing.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>
			</center>
			
			
			<h4> Conclusion</h4>
			<p align="justify"><small>In conclusion, the prototype showed how messages could be encrypted, decrypted and stored in a database safely. In real-life applications it is advisable to save the keys in another separate server.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints and limited resources amongst team members, the authors could not cooperate/collaborate with another server to manage the keys. Nonetheless, the prototype inspires confidence that symmetric cryptography can guarantee users a secure and better cyber experience. </small></p>
