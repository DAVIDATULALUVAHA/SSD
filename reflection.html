												<h3>Reflections on the individual contributions and the teamwork process.</h3>
												<h4>Part 1: The Design Proposal Report</h4>
												<h4>During the period under review:</h4>
											</header>
												<font size="3" face="Arial" color="white"
												<p align="justify"><small>I participated meaningfully to team discussions, exhibited a helpful and supportive attitude through contributing diligently towards the team process by consulting regularly with team members and gave valuable contributions about what project we should undertake during the module.  As proof of concept, I designed a Symmetric cryptography program shown in Figure 1 that was able to run from the windows command line in order to convince members that my idea will work. They looked at it and became convinced that the idea was good. They then made approval that we should go ahead with the Design Proposal Report based on the idea. </small></p>		
										       	
											
												<center>
												<span class="image">
													<img src="images/cryptopro.jpg" alt="" />
												</span>
												</center>
												<p align="justify"><small> I developed to about 75% of the content in the Design Proposal Report now that I was the originator of the idea with the knowhow of how it worked. In Design Proposal Report  I contributed towards development of  the content in System design, overview of the proposed solution, approach, theories and practices used on the project, tools and all the diagrams found in the Figure 3.  The other team members contributed the rest of the content and played a vital role of editing and formatting the content to meet the standards. </small></p>	
												
												<center>
												<span class="image">
													<img src="images/figure3.jpg" alt="" />
												</span>
												</center>
												
												<p align="justify"><small>I prepared quality work and delivered my share of work to the group leader in a timely manner which lead to early submission of the report for marking.</small></p>
												 <p align="justify"><small>As shown in Figure 4, I interconnected effectively with team members through WhatsApp to ensure that we were all in tandem on what we should do at all times.</small></p>	
																														
												
												<center>
												<span class="image">

												</span>
												</center>
												
												<p align="justify">I contributed to the layout of the report to ensure that the content in the report was fitting on one page as required and selected relevant diagrams for the topic. In future I will delve deeper and explain more on them. The tutor commented positively on the same.<small></small></p>
												<p align="justify"><small>Last but not least I contributed to selecting relevant sources and having a set of good references.  My efforts contributed positively to the score in the team design. The tutor commented positively on the same too. I will continue with the same spirit in future assignments.</small></p>
												
																						
												
												<h4>Part 2: Development Team Project: Coding Output</h4>
											   </header>
															
										        <h4>During the period under review:</h4>
												<p align="justify">I participated diligently and meaningfully towards the coding of the prototype and exhibited a helpful and supportive attitude through contributing diligently towards the team process. I was tasked to code the system while the rest of the team members valuably contributed towards testing the source codes.</small></p>    
												<p align="justify">I took part in the demonstration of the prototype to the tutors although due to technical problem there was no sound. Nonetheless during the demonstration the group leader came in handy and explained what the system was all about. I apologized for the technical hitch and reassured the tutors that the readme that we had prepared was detailed enough and reflected the capability of the prototype. </small></p> 
												<p align="justify">I equally fully participated in the preparation of the readme by producing about 90% of the content inform of text, images and codes. The other team members played a vital role in producing the rest of the content on testing of the system, reading and editing the readme to ensure that it was understandable. The team members were supportive and gave me a good working environment when I was coding the prototype. </small></p>
												<p align="justify">It was good working within this team, members were patient with me, supportive and understood that as the programmer my task was the hardest. In future if asked to work with the same team members I will humbly accept. </small></p>
												<p align="justify">Last but not least, at the end of the day, after all is said and done and after my experience in group two,  I consider myself to be a valuable and reliable team player  who is able to delivers  in a timely manner under pressure before deadlines. </small></p>
